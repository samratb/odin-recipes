    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Jhalmuri</strong> is a popular street snack in the Bengali cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, made of puffed rice and an assortment of Indian spices, vegetables, Bombay mix (chanachur) and mustard oil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients of Jhal Muri</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups puffed rice (muri)</li>
        <li>1 medium boiled potato, cubed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cucumber, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh chopped coconut (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mustard oil (for authentic flavor)</li>
        <li>1 tsp black salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp chaat masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp roasted cumin powder (jeera powder)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 to 1 lime</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sev or chanachur (for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the puffed rice, cubed boiled potato, chopped onion, chopped tomato, chopped green chilies, roasted peanuts, optional chopped cucumber, and optional chopped coconut.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the seasonings:</strong> Sprinkle the black salt, chaat masala, roasted cumin powder (jeera powder), and red chili powder over the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Introduce the liquids:</strong> Drizzle the mustard oil over the ingredients and squeeze in the fresh lime juice.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix vigorously and quickly:</strong> Use a large spoon to toss all the ingredients together thoroughly. The key is to mix quickly to ensure an even coating before the puffed rice absorbs too much moisture and loses its crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and serve immediately:</strong> Transfer the Jhal Muri into serving bowls or paper cones, top with sev or chanachur, and garnish with the fresh chopped coriander leaves. Serve immediately while fresh and crunchy.</li>
