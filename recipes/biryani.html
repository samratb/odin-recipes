    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take medium to large size potatoes, wash and peel them. Cut into halves or quarters and cook until tender.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes completely cool down, heat a pan with 1/2 cup of ghee and 1/2 cup of oil on medium flame, then fry the potatoes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, fry onions until crispy.</li>
        <li>Prepare Bengali biryani masala by dry roasting shahi jeera, white peppercorn (shah morich), cardamom, mace, cinnamon stick, nutmeg, kabab china, and cloves on a low flame until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Cool the spices and grind them into a powder.</li>
        <li>Clean and wash the chicken pieces (curry cut), ensuring they are large in size.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix 1/2 cup of curd, 1 tsp of kashmiri chilli powder, and 1/2 tsp of salt.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the curd mixture, then add 2 tsp of garlic paste, 1 1/2 tsp of ginger paste, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 tsp of the prepared biryani masala powder and mix nicely.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon into the mixture for marination.</li>
        <li>Add a handful of fried onions and mix together. Marinate for at least 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After marination, place the marinated chicken in the pan used for frying onions and cook on medium flame.</li>
        <li>Cook for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces and cover the pan with a lid to cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the chicken pieces again and cook for another 8-10 minutes without the lid until the gravy mostly dries up.</li>
        <li>Wash 1 kg of basmati or long grain rice gently and soak for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large vessel, bring 3/4 water to a boil. Add salt, refined oil, bay leaves, green cardamoms, cloves, and cinnamon sticks.</li>
        <li>Once the water boils, strain the soaked rice and add it to the vessel. Cook until the rice is 80 percent done.</li>
        <li>Immediately drain the starch and spread the rice on plates to cool down completely.</li>
        <li>Prepare saffron milk by soaking a pinch of saffron strands in warm milk for 15-20 minutes, then rubbing the strands to release more color.</li>
        <li>Add kewra water, 3 drops of rose essence, and 8-9 drops of mitha attar to the saffron milk mixture and mix well.</li>
        <li>To assemble, take a thick-bottomed vessel and spread bay leaves on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Spread a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick layer of rice on the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Place two chicken pieces and three pieces of potatoes on the first layer, then add 3-4 tbsp of chicken gravy.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1/2 tsp biryani masala, 3-4 tsp of the essence-added saffron milk, 2-3 tsp of ghee, a handful of crispy fried onion, and 1/2 tsp of salt over the layer.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of rice to completely cover the first layer.</li>
        <li>Assemble the next layer using the same process, then cover with white rice and make a third layer similarly.</li>
        <li>Cover the last layer with ample rice, then sprinkle 3-4 tsp of ghee, a pinch of biryani masala, and salt. Place hard-boiled eggs on top and close the lid.</li>
        <li>Put the biryani vessel on the lowest heat of the oven and place another pan full of hot water on top of the lid.</li>
        <li>Cook for 30-45 minutes or until the outer side and lid of the vessel are very hot to the touch.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Kolkata special chicken biryani is ready to serve with a side dish or salad.</li>
